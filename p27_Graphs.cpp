/*
1. Graph is a collection of Nodes connected by Edges
2. Types of graphs- 
Directed : edges are single directional
Undirected : edges are Bi-directional

3. Degree of a Node(for Undirected graph)- no. of other nodes directly connected to that node/no of edges attached to that node.
for directed graph, 
Indegree- no. of edges pointing towards the node
Outdegree- no. of edges pointing out from that node

4. Weighted graph- a graph with some weight value on every edge, every edge can have same/different weight values, for normal unweighted graphs,weights are assumed to be 1

5. Path- a sequence of nodes, where each node in the path is visited exactly once
6. Cyclic graph-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-cyclic-graph/
7. Graph representation- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/
